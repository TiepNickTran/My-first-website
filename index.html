  <h3>About Tiep Nick Tran</h3>
  <p class="about">As someone who love and respect art since childhood, I became a photographer to capture life's beautiful <br>moments and maybe I could humbly contribute to society by preserving beautiful sceneries of nature. <br><br>My current goal is getting into a career that allow me to work remotely so I can travel as nature's photographer. <br>This is one of the few reasons why I really love coding.
  <br><br>As a student of <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">thinkful.com</a>, I hope to learn as much as I could and try my best to quickly master these vital skills.</p>
